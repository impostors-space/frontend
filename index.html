        <h2>Hi, did you ever wonder if theres an online version of Imposter?</h2>
        <p>If you did, you may have stumbled over the fact that there aren't really online versions of Impostor, just some cheap Among us copies. <br> That is why we decided to make our own version of Impostor. Online!
        </p>
        </p><br><h2>How the game works:</h2><p>Impostor, you can join a so called "Post". In that Post you can either be Innocent or THE IMPOSTOR!!! All Innocents can see the initial Post which contains the word that is to be described.
         <br>The Impostor can't see the initial Post so he doesn't know the word. Then every Member has to describe the word while not directly naming it. <br> The Impostor also has to describe the word based on the Innocents comments.
          <br>Comments can be up- and downvoted. Based on the amount of down-/upvotes you 123receive an amount of Points after the Impostor is revealed after 7 days.<br> </p><h3>So if you want to play the game. Sign in or register and jump into a refreshing round of IMPOSTOR!!!</h3>
